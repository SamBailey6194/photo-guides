# Photo Guides

**Photo Guides** is a site that aims to provide explanations, advice and guidance on camera bodies, lenses and settings. So beginner and amateur photographers have a good starting point for equipment required and how to use the equipment. Therefore, this site will be targeted at users who are beginners or amateurs in photography. It will provide in simple language different camera bodies, lenses and how to use the equipment. To help inspire the users we will also provide an area that explains the history of photography and some famous photographers to draw inspiration from. **Photo Guides** therefore will be useful for beginner and amateur photographers by helping them understand the equipment, how to use it and providing inspiration to guide them and their style.

The decision to make this website is due to the user stories found [here](userstory.md).

### Features Left to Implement

- Make the "Setting Tutorial" be a dropdown and have "Lighting Triangle", "ISO", "Shutter Speed", and "Aperture" as options.
  - "Lighting Triangle" would have the two sections on the current "Setting Tutorial" page
  - The other 3 pages would go into detail and use images as examples to explain how to use that specific setting clearly

## Lessons Learnt

- After chatting with my mentor I learnt that my commit messages need to have a standard format, having the verb word at the start, from commit 57 I hope to acheive this.

## Testing 

The website has been tested; including internal (buttons and navbar) & external links, responsive design, and forms; on Opera GX, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

### Fixed Bugs

- Contact Form in footer wasn't submitting nor saying why the form wasn't submitting, upon inspection the input type was set to "button", so this was changed to input type "submit"
- Contact form button was decreasing in size when hovered over and pulling up the social media links at the bottom, therefore the border was made solid so there was no change in size, this meant the socials in the footer didn't move up
- Contact button in navbar always took you back to homepage due to the href was linked to index.html#contact therefore the index.html was removed and just the #contact was left to enable the contact button to take you to the contact form in the footer of the page, enabling a smoother user experience
- The cards on the homepage were the different heights and widths across different screen sizes, therefore media queries were added to ensure they all matched across the different screen sizes
- The gaps between the cards on the homepage were too big on the bigger screen sizes, therefore media queries were added to ensure they were responsive across all screen sizes
- Camera Lenses section on Equipment page background wasn't stretching the full width due to contianer fluid class was in the main element, used sections to make it clearer so the background stretched the full width.
- Price point tables were too bit on mobile devices, added table-responsive to ensure they fit nicely on all device sizes.
- Photo Carousels were clicking through the top carousel only, changed the IDs of each carousel to enable the buttons moved the correct carousel
- Carousels on Photo History page were not clicking to next or previous images due to misspelling of IDs, corrected spellings of the IDs
- Famous photographer carousels not in line on all device sizes, added media queries to ensure they are
- Removed closing tag div that had no opening div on index.html
- Removed space in image link on equipment.html
- Removed closing tag p that had no opening p on equipment.html
- Changed name to be valid for lighting triangle image
- Added a closing div tag to tutorial.html to how to use light triangle section
- Removed space for ID for history section
