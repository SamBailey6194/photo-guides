# Photo Guides

**Photo Guides** is a site that aims to provide explanations, advice and guidance on camera bodies, lenses and settings. So beginner and amateur photographers have a good starting point for equipment required and how to use the equipment. Therefore, this site will be targeted at users who are beginners or amateurs in photography. It will provide in simple language different camera bodies, lenses and how to use the equipment. To help inspire the users we will also provide an area that explains the history of photography and some famous photographers to draw inspiration from. **Photo Guides** therefore will be useful for beginner and amateur photographers by helping them understand the equipment, how to use it and providing inspiration to guide them and their style.

The decision to make this website is due to the user stories found [here](userstory.md).

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

- Contact Form in footer wasn't submitting nor saying why the form wasn't submitting, upon inspection the input type was set to "button", so this was changed to input type "submit"
- Contact form button was decreasing in size when hovered over and pulling up the social media links at the bottom, therefore the border was made solid so there was no change in size, this meant the socials in the footer didn't move up
- Contact button in navbar always took you back to homepage due to the href was linked to index.html#contact therefore the index.html was removed and just the #contact was left to enable the contact button to take you to the contact form in the footer of the page, enabling a smoother user experience
- The cards on the homepage were the different heights and widths across different screen sizes, therefore media queries were added to ensure they all matched across the different screen sizes
- The gaps between the cards on the homepage were too big on the bigger screen sizes, therefore media queries were added to ensure they were responsive across all screen sizes
- Camera Lenses section on Equipment page background wasn't stretching the full width due to contianer fluid class was in the main element, used sections to make it clearer so the background stretched the full width.

## Credits 

Below are my credits for where I got inspiration for some of the code, where the content came from and where media is from.

## Code

- There has been use of Bootstrap library for CSS and JS across all pages and sections
- Sharp-corners code in custom CSS is from Portfolio Website Mei
- Love Running inspired the code for the footer being at the bottom of the page and the social media icons in the footer*
- Boardwalk games inspired the code for the success page*

*Not all the code for these items are exact copies, some edits were made 

### Content 

- The majority of the text (not the code) has been generated first using chatgpt and then edited.
- All icons were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

- All images are either from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com), where possible the exact photographer and source is credited under the image.
